New Learning New Life
Broken, rebuilding with worn out tools...
Committed to improvement, optimizing potential, and growing into the best version of the self.

Time to strengthen this committment... 

continue strength training as it were...

simply finishing a course is no longer good enough, now need to CREATE PROGRAMS using what you have learned, also, not enough just to read, need to do as well...

just play a lot and take things in as you can unconsciously at first and also combine that with conscious effort in learning...

continue with the programming...

need to flush out all destructive thoughts... also need to stop repeating old thoughts... need to come up with new thoughts...
also renew good habit from the big conference...

to do for today -- apply to FIFB program, write blockchain, make blockchain presentation, write some GHMBHK, write some NLP program, but CITE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY...
