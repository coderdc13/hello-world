New Learning New Life
Broken, rebuilding with worn out tools...
Committed to improvement, optimizing potential, and growing into the best version of the self.

Time to strengthen this committment... 

continue strength training as it were...

simply finishing a course is no longer good enough, now need to CREATE PROGRAMS using what you have learned, also, not enough just to read, need to do as well...
